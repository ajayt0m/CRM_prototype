# CRM_prototype

The MSME sector is a critical part of any economy, and it comprises a large number of businesses that operate in various industries. These businesses face many challenges, including intense competition, limited resources, and a constantly evolving market.

To stay competitive and grow their businesses, MSMEs need to build strong relationships with their customers. They need to understand their customers' needs, preferences, and behaviours and provide them with personalized and timely services. However, many MSMEs struggle to manage customer data effectively and efficiently, which can lead to lost opportunities, decreased customer satisfaction, and decreased revenue.

A CRM system can help MSMEs address these challenges by providing them with a centralized platform to manage customer data. By storing customer data in a structured and organized manner, MSMEs can gain insights into their customers' behaviours, preferences, and needs, which can help them tailor their services and improve customer satisfaction. A CRM system can also automate many of the routine tasks involved in customer management, such as lead tracking, sales forecasting, and customer support, which can save MSMEs time and resources.

As of now, this project is a prototype being developed by a single individual. The goal is to create a low-cost and user-friendly CRM solution that can help MSMEs effectively manage their customer relationships, automate tasks, and boost revenue generation.
